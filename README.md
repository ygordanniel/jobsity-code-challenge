# Bowling Challenge

This is an implementation for [Jobsity](https://www.jobsity.com/) Java Code challenge.

## Development

`jarRun` depends on `build` the jar will be preemptively built before the first run.
To start the application simply run:

```shell

./gradlew jarRun -Pfile="path/to/file.txt"
```


## Testing

To launch tests, run:

```shell

./gradlew test
```

You can check tests results opening `./build/reports/tests/test/index.html`
